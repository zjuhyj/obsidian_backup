  abstract = {森林生态系统是地表最为重要的组成要素,其扰动对生物多样性,生境质量以及生态系统功能均产生重大影响。其中森林火灾与采伐是造成森林扰动的主要因素,森林火灾的发生会导致森林土壤质量恶化,大量植被烧毁,野生动物栖息地破坏,进而影响整个生态系统平衡。不合理的森林采伐活动会影响森林资源的利用与保护,影响人类社会的可持续发展。因遥感卫星技术的高时效、低成本和大尺度等优势,已经成为森林扰动监测的有效手段。实现森林扰动遥感精准识别,对森林资源和生态环境的保护,人类社会可持续发展均具有重要意义。 本文以山西省为研究区,收集了MODIS、Landsat等遥感数据与统计数据,获取了森林火灾与采伐的样本点,建立了森林火灾与采伐干扰样本数据集,使用LSI(Landscape Shape Index)形状指数描述森林干扰前后的结构变化,构建了森林火灾与采伐的标准时序曲线。基于NBR(Normalized Burn Ratio)归一化燃烧比率,运用Land Trendr变化检测算法识别出研究区内的森林干扰区,使用DTW(Dynamic Time Warping)算法计算研究区内干扰森林的前一年、当年和后四年的时序曲线与未扰动森林的标准时序曲线之间的距离,创新性提出了基于对象时序分析的森林扰动遥感识别方法。该方法能高效、便捷、低成本地识别大尺度下的森林火灾与采伐干扰类型。论文主要的工作与研究结论如下: (1)单独使用NBR指数,不能较好的识别森林火灾和采伐,而融合了地物对象结构指数与NBR能够识别出森林火灾与采伐,提高了森林火灾与采伐识别的精度,总体精度达到了82.7\%和89.3\%。 (2)从LSI变化轨迹分析,火灾因其干扰迹面积大,形状不规则,因此复杂度变化大,相比与采伐迹地,火灾的LSI相对较高。且火灾具有恢复时间短、恢复速度快等特点,较容易恢复成原来的LSI值。 (3)本研究识别的火灾点为502个,采伐点4310个。从时空分布上,火灾历年发生的次数较为离散,地点分散,两者没有明显的规律。而采伐点空间上呈现均匀分布,发生时间十分频繁,且森林采伐次数呈现逐年下降趋势。},

  abstract = {Evidence of shifting dominance among major forest disturbance agent classes regionally to globally has been emerging in the literature. For example, climate-related stress and secondary stressors on forests (e.g., insect and disease, fire) have dramatically increased since the turn of the century globally, while harvest rates in the western US and elsewhere have declined. For shifts to be quantified, accurate historical forest disturbance estimates are required as a baseline for examining current trends. We report annual disturbance rates (with uncertainties) in the aggregate and by major change causal agent class for the conterminous US and five geographic subregions between 1985 and 2012. Results are based on human interpretations of Landsat time series from a probability sample of 7200 plots (30 m) distributed throughout the study area. Forest disturbance information was recorded with a Landsat time series visualization and data collection tool that incorporates ancillary high-resolution data. National rates of disturbance varied between 1.5\% and 4.5\% of forest area per year, with trends being strongly affected by shifting dominance among specific disturbance agent influences at the regional scale. Throughout the time series, national harvest disturbance rates varied between one and two percent, and were largely a function of harvest in the more heavily forested regions of the US (Mountain West, Northeast, and Southeast). During the first part of the time series, national disturbance rates largely reflected trends in harvest disturbance. Beginning in the mid-90s, forest decline-related disturbances associated with diminishing forest health (e.g., physiological stress leading to tree canopy cover loss, increases in tree mortality above background levels), especially in the Mountain West and Lowland West regions of the US, increased dramatically. Consequently, national disturbance rates greatly increased by 2000, and remained high for much of the decade. Decline-related disturbance rates reached as high as 8\% per year in the western regions during the early-2000s. Although low compared to harvest and decline, fire disturbance rates also increased in the early- to mid-2000s. We segmented annual decline-related disturbance rates to distinguish between newly impacted areas and areas undergoing gradual but consistent decline over multiple years. We also translated Landsat reflectance change into tree canopy cover change information for greater relevance to ecosystem modelers and forest managers, who can derive better understanding of forest-climate interactions and better adapt management strategies to changing climate regimes. Similar studies could be carried out for other countries where there are sufficient Landsat data and historic temporal snapshots of high-resolution imagery.},

  abstract = {It is expected that European Boreal and Temperate forests will be greatly affected by climate change, causing natural disturbances to increase in frequency and severity. To detangle how, through forest management, we can make forests less vulnerable to the impact of natural disturbances, we need to include the risks of such distur\- bances in our decision-making tools. The present review investigates: i) how the most important forestry-related natural disturbances are linked to climate change, and ii) different modelling approaches that assess the risks of natural disturbances and their applicability for large-scale forest management planning. Global warming will decrease frozen soil periods, which increases root rot, snow, ice and wind damage, cascading into an increment of bark beetle damage. Central Europe will experience a decrease in precipitation and increase in temperature, which lowers tree defenses against bark beetles and increases root rot infestations. Ice and wet snow damages are expected to increase in Northern Boreal forests, and to reduce in Temperate and Southern Boreal forests. However, lack of snow cover may increase cases of frost-damaged seedlings. The increased temperatures and drought periods, together with a fuel increment from other disturbances, likely enhance wildfire risk, especially for Temperate forests. For the review of European modelling approaches, thirty-nine disturbance models were assessed and categorized according to their required input variables and to the models' outputs. Probability models are usually common for all disturbance model approaches, however, models that predict disturbance effects seem to be scarce.},

The goal of this paper is to explore the use of a subset of Landsat time series and deep learning models to identify both the type and the year of disturbances, including low-severity and gradual disturbances, in the boreal forest of eastern Canada at the pixel level. Remote sensing data such as the spectral information from Landsat time series are the best available option for large scale observations of disturbances that go back decades. Traditional modeling approaches, like LandTrendr, require substantial handcrafted pre-processing to remove noise and to extract temporal features from the image sequences before using them as input to a classical machine-learning model. Deep-learning models can autonomously discern which features are relevant within the coarse temporal and spectral information from the Landsat annual dense time series.},

  abstract = {Background and objective: Forests play a crucial role throughout the world as highly productive ecosystems, serving approximately a quarter of the human population by providing valuable services. However, these ecosystems are subject to various natural and human-induced disturbances such as insect outbreaks, fires, windthrow, snow damage, selective logging, and harvest, which significantly influence the composition and structure of forests. Recent studies have observed a notable increase in both natural and anthropogenic disturbances on a global scale. The availability of free Earth observation (EO) archives alongside the maturation of algorithms for analysing time series data have opened new opportunities to detect and understand forest disturbances in a vast spatio-temporal context. Over the past few decades, numerous EO-based approaches have been proposed to monitor forest ecosystems, benefiting from the open-data policies of multiple satellite constellations. This study conducted a mapping review to shed light on the state-of-the-art in forest disturbance characterization using EO big data. Study design: We searched major online databases, including Scopus, the Web of Science, MDPI, Science Direct and IEEE Xplore, extensively in order to identify scientific literature published from 1995 to 2023. Of the more than 2000 records screened, 104 publications met the specific inclusion criteria and were included in the review. The selected studies were categorized based on the type of spatial and spectral-temporal patterns used to characterize forest disturbances, the predictors employed to classify the target disturbances, the data fusion methods applied when using multisource EO data, the classification algorithms employed and the accessibility of the reference data used in the studies. Results: Our findings reveal that temporal patterns derived from spectral reflectance have been used three times more frequently than spatial patterns. The most common predictors were the spectral change magnitude and timing of disturbances derived from the short-wave infrared (SWIR) spectral region, along with measures of disturbed patch dimensions and elevation. The random forest emerged as the most used algorithm for classification. Furthermore, it was observed that less than 10\% of the studies provided or made available the datasets used for their analyses. Conclusion: Although significant progress has been made in characterizing forest disturbances, the validity and credibility of results were found to be highly variable and much dependent on the choice of change detection methods, predictors and classification algorithms. The scarcity of research studies that provide access to their data poses a significant obstacle to the advancement of current methodologies and the development of novel approaches.},

  abstract = {Remote sensing is widely used to detect forest disturbances (e.g., wildfires, harvest, or outbreaks of pathogens or insects) over spatiotemporal scales that are infeasible to capture with field surveys. To understand forest ecosystem dynamics and the ecological role of human and natural disturbances, researchers and managers would like to characterize spatiotemporal patterns of several types of disturbance. Recent advances include the development and testing of algorithms to automatically detect and attribute an array of disturbance types across large forest landscapes from remotely sensed imagery. We reviewed the scientific literature for automated disturbance type attribution in forest ecosystems to synthesize current knowledge and inform future work. We created metrics that characterize study contexts, methods, and outcomes to evaluate 34 studies that automated the attribution of several (two or more) forest disturbance types. Reported accuracies of {\textasciitilde}80\% for up to eight disturbance types at local (500 km2) to continental (6.5 {\texttimes} 106 km2) spatial extents reaffirm the potential for attributing forest disturbances from remote sensing data at scales relevant to ecological research and forest management. Generally, greater accuracies were reported for attributing disturbance types that affect most of a pixel and exhibit spectral signatures distinct from other disturbances or the prior (undisturbed) condition. Accuracy of attributing disturbance type tends to be notably lower for disturbances with smaller spatial extents or resulting in subtle spectral changes, such as small patches of tree mortality covering {$<$}40\% of a pixel or areas of tree damage without evident mortality (e.g., defoliator outbreaks). Nearly all (33 of 34) studies used Landsat image time series to attribute disturbance types because the Landsat archive is freely accessible, spans several decades (allowing longer-term change analyses), is calibrated to facilitate change analyses, and has multiple spectral bands that aid algorithms. In our synthesis, most studies focused on specific disturbance types of interest within a particular study area, rather than a comprehensive list of types that would make the algorithm more generally applicable at broader spatial extents. We recommend several future research areas to improve the thematic resolution, accuracy, and potentially the transferability of attribution algorithms. Further development and testing of algorithms will continue to reveal the most effective approaches for attributing disturbance types that have been more difficult to detect with available spectral data to date, such as insect damage or low severity wildfire, and to evaluate model sensitivity as well as accuracy. The lessons that collectively emerge from automated forest disturbance attribution studies have the potential to guide future research and management applications.},

  abstract = {Forest disturbances greatly affect the ecological functioning of natural forests. Timely information regarding extent, timing and magnitude of forest disturbance events is crucial for effective disturbance management strategies. Yet, we still lack accurate, near-real-time and high-performance remote sensing tools for monitoring abrupt and subtle forest disturbances. This study presents a new approach called `Stochastic Continuous Change Detection (S-CCD)' using a dense Landsat data time series. S-CCD improves upon the `COntinuous monitoring of Land Disturbance (COLD)' approach by incorporating a mathematical tool called the `state space model', which treats trends and seasonality as stochastic processes, allowing for modeling temporal dynamics of satellite observations in a recursive way. The quantitative accuracy assessment is evaluated based on 3782 Landsat-based disturbance reference plots (30 m) from a probability sampling distributed throughout the Conterminous United States. Validation results show that the overall accuracy (best F1 score) of S-CCD is 0.793 with 20\% omission error and 21\% commission error, slightly higher than that of COLD (0.789). Two disturbance sites respectively associated with wildfire and insect disturbances are used for qualitative map-based analysis. Both quantitative and qualitative analyses suggest that S-CCD achieves fewer omission errors than COLD for detecting those disturbances with subtle/gradual spectral change. In addition, S-CCD facilitates a better real-time monitoring, benefited by its complete recursive manner and a shorter lag for confirming disturbance than COLD (126 days vs. 166 days for alerting 50\% disturbance events), and reached up to {\textasciitilde}4.4 times speedup for computation. This research addresses the need for near-real-time monitoring and large-scale mapping of forest health and offers a new approach for operationally performing change detection tasks from dense Landsat-based time series.},

  abstract = {An accurate mapping of land disturbances with regard to their timing and locations is the prerequisite for the success of downstream disturbance characterization. This study introduces and tests a novel approach that integrates a spatial perspective into the dense Landsat time series analysis, called ``Object-Based COntinuous monitoring of Land Disturbance'' (OB-COLD). The new algorithm is based on the recognition that the pixels under effects of the same disturbance event often present similar spectral change concurrently in a short time; such pixels experiencing concurrent change could be grouped as an analytic spatial unit, namely ``change object''. OB-COLD first generates a change-magnitude snapshot every 60 days by applying per-pixel time series analysis to measure spectral change history. Then, an object-based change analysis is applied for each time-stamped snapshot: two levels of change objects are generated through over-segmentation and region merging; the changing area is determined by examining three object-level properties derived at different scales: the average change magnitude, the pre-change cover type, and the object size. Lastly, OB-COLD reconstructs model coefficients for each temporal segment based on the temporal breaks indicated by new snapshot-based change maps. We tested the new algorithm using 3000 randomly selected reference sample plots and eight Landsat ARD tiles across the continental United States. The accuracy assessment suggests that OB-COLD achieved 76.9\% producer's accuracy, which is significantly higher than the per-pixel time series algorithm (i.e., COLD) (16.3 percentage increase) while keeping a comparable user's accuracies (58.7\% vs. 57.8\%). The quantitative and qualitative evaluations both suggest that OB-COLD could significantly reduce omission errors, particularly for stress disturbances. Most commission errors (73\%) are attributed to agricultural practices and climate variability. The proposed algorithm is computationally scalable to large-scale spatiotemporal datasets with advanced cyberinfrastructure resources, holding great potential as the base detection algorithm for the next generation of land disturbance products.},

  abstract = {准确提取森林扰动信息能为全球碳汇估算、森林可持续管理等研究提供基础的数据支撑。针对森林扰动遥感监测研究中缺乏高效提取森林覆盖不变区域方法的情况,本研究充分利用已有土地覆盖分类产品中包含的样本-地类关系,搭建监督分类训练样本的自动提取框架,构建了多时期土地覆盖自动分类方法。同时,针对现有扰动检测算法在历史森林扰动资料匮乏区域应用受限,本研究将森林扰动检测转换为时间序列数据集中序列异常检测问题,提出了一种基于深度序列到序列自编码器的半监督学习森林扰动检测模型。论文主要工作和结论如下:（1）森林覆盖不变区域提取为森林扰动监测开展的前提,其本质为多时期土地覆盖分类,本研究针对土地覆盖分类中训练样本收集费时费力问题,以现有土地覆盖产品为样本-地物类别关系知识库,借助样本关系迁移理论、IR-MAD变化检测和局部可达密度方法实现了样本-地物类别关系的跨时期迁移以及高置信样本的自动筛选,并结合随机森林算法实现了多时期土地覆盖分类的全自动制图。该方法获取的分类结果在四个时期的总体精度均达到85\%以上,其中森林覆盖的用户和制作者精度均大于90\%。（2）针对现有扰动检测算法在历史扰动资料匮乏区域应用困难的问题,本研究从时间序列异常检测角度出发,将扰动森林时间序列视为时间序列中的异常,采用结合注意力机制的序列到序列自编码器作为半监督学习模型,以未扰动森林遥感指数时间序列为训练样本,结合异常检测理论构建森林扰动自动检测模型。模型扰动检测的总体精度为92.7\%,且具有较强的泛化能力。此外,不同算法间的对比分析中所提模型也获得了更高的扰动森林检测精度。（3）基于所构建的扰动检测模型开展湖南省阳明山区域的森林扰动时空变化特征分析以及探索扰动发生与环境因素间的关系。阳明山森林覆盖不变区域中大约25\%发生了森林扰动现象,面积约为454.88km\textsuperscript{2},其中绝大部分扰动属于轻度和中度扰动,且持续时长多在4-6年。结合该区域地形、居民地和道路基础数据定量化分析发现海拔越低（{$<$}500m）,离居民地（{$<$}9km）和道路（{$<$}800m）越近,扰动发生的概率越大。},

  abstract = {We developed a new algorithm for COntinuous monitoring of Land Disturbance (COLD) using Landsat time series. COLD can detect many kinds of land disturbance continuously as new images are collected and provide historical land disturbance maps retrospectively. To better detect land disturbance, we tested different kinds of input data and explored many time series analysis techniques. We have several major observations as follows. First, time series of surface reflectance provides much better detection results than time series of Top-OfAtmosphere (TOA) reflectance, and with some adjustments to the temporal density, time series from Landsat Analysis Ready Data (ARD) is better than it is from the same Landsat scene. Second, the combined use of spectral bands is always better than using a single spectral band or index, and if all the essential spectral bands have been employed, the inclusion of other indices does not further improve the algorithm performance. Third, the remaining outliers in the time series can be removed based on their deviation from model predicted values based on probability-based thresholds derived from normal or chi-squared distributions. Fourth, model initialization is pivotal for monitoring land disturbance, and a good initialization stability test can influence algorithm performance substantially. Fifth, time series model estimation with eight coefficients model, updated for every single observation, based on all available clear observations achieves the best result. Sixth, a change probability of 0.99 (chi-squared distribution) with six consecutive anomaly observations and a mean included angle {$<$} 45{$^\circ$} to confirm a change provide the best results, and the combined use of temporally-adjusted Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and minimum RMSE is recommended. Finally, spectral changes (or ``breaks'') contributed from vegetation regrowth should be excluded from land disturbance maps. The COLD algorithm was developed and calibrated based on all these lessons learned above. The accuracy assessment shows that COLD results were accurate for detecting land disturbance, with an omission error of 27\% and a commission error of 28\%.},
